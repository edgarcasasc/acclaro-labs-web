## Executive Summary

A leading financial institution in Mexico faced a familiar operational challenge: scaling its collections operation in a key northern hub from **10 to 50 seats** without absorbing the structural costs of the traditional path (office expansion, call center attrition, constant ramp-up, and increased labor liabilities).

**Acclaro Labs** proposed a different approach: don’t add hands—build a **digital brain** capable of handling high-volume outreach with higher quality, strict regulatory compliance, and optimized *unit economics* from day one.

> **The Outcome:** A hybrid workforce architecture where AI handles the repetitive, high-throughput work, while human experts focus on complex cases where judgment and deep empathy drive outcomes.

## 1. The problem: scaling without breaking the system

Scaling from 10 to 50 collections seats typically means:

* Expanding physical footprint and supervision overhead.
* Absorbing high turnover common to call centers (recruiting and continuous training).
* Increasing labor liabilities and long-term fixed costs.
* Degrading customer experience as volume pressure overtakes quality.

We framed the core question clearly: **Can we scale capacity by 500% without hiring 50 additional agents—while improving the customer experience?**

Our answer: yes—if the system makes better decisions than a predictive dialer.

## 2. Design principle: Event-Driven Architecture

### Phase 1 — Reverse engineering global leaders

We started with a technical deep dive into global leaders in autonomous and digital-first collections: **TrueAccord** (U.S.), **Skit.ai** (India), and **InDebted** (Australia).

**Key insight:**
A common failure mode in LATAM is equating “automation” with brute force: predictive dialers, lists, and call volume.

Top operators use an **Event-Driven architecture** where the system:

1.  **Detects:** Micro-signals of customer behavior (responses, intent cues, timing windows).
2.  **Selects:** The optimal channel (WhatsApp, SMS, voice).
3.  **Adapts:** Tone, *timing*, and objective (inform, negotiate, confirm commitment).

In short: **it doesn’t call to call—it decides why, when, and how.**

## 3. The Model Battle: Benchmark

### Phase 2 — Stress-testing LLMs (December 2025)

For the “brain” of the agent, we conducted A/B stress tests across top-tier language models. We optimized for two metrics that determine real-world performance in collections:

1.  **Latency** (perceived responsiveness).
2.  **Emotional intelligence** (staying effective under tension).

### What we found

| Model | Strengths | Operational Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Academic Analyst** | Excellent reasoning and pristine grammar. | Under escalation, safety filters often terminated the interaction, breaking negotiation and increasing friction. |
| **Empathetic Negotiator** | Understands slang, holds character under pressure. | Requires finer prompt engineering to maintain professional boundaries. |

**Architectural Decision:** We chose the "Empathetic Negotiator". In collections, negotiation quality is as important as content correctness. The conversation is the product.

## 4. Safety & Guardrails: The Compliance Layer

### Phase 3 — Deterministic controls over probabilistic generation

In financial services, hallucinations create legal and reputational risk. We implemented a deterministic safety layer with three pillars:

1.  **Data Sovereignty:** Debtor data and business rules remain in encrypted local infrastructure, isolated from the AI provider’s public cloud.
2.  **Hard-coded Compliance Guardrails:** While the AI generates dialogue, rigid code enforces that:
    * No threats or coercive language are used.
    * Contact windows align with regulations (**CONDUSEF**).
    * Settlement offers are mathematically pre-approved by bank rules.
3.  **“Supervised AI” Architecture:** The model does not invent policies; it operates inside a constrained corridor.

## 5. Unit Economics: Innovation that pays for itself

### Phase 4 — A cascading cost strategy

We built profitability into the system design by comparing fully loaded costs per successful “management action” (reference figures):

* Human cost per action: **~MXN $38**
* Premium AI operating cost: **~MXN $15**

From there, we designed a value-tiered strategy:

* **Mass Tier (Low Cost):** Small-balance accounts handled by an optimized lower-cost model (~MXN $4.50).
* **High-Value Tier (Premium):** Larger accounts handled by a premium model with hyper-realistic voice and maximum negotiation capability.

## Outcome: A Hybrid Workforce

The goal was not “replace humans,” but reallocate work to where it creates the most value:

* AI executes the **high-volume, repetitive 80%** (initial outreach, reminders, structured follow-ups).
* Human specialists focus on: complex cases, sensitive negotiations, and exceptions requiring judgment.

At **Acclaro Labs**, we don’t “install bots.” We design financial and operational architectures where AI decisioning is safe, compliant, and profitable.
